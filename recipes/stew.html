    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef chuck roast, cubed into 1-1.5 inch pieces</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Vegetables</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Onions, chopped</li>
            <li>Carrots, peeled and cut into chunks or rounds</li>
            <li>Potatoes, cubed (baby potatoes or Yukon Gold are recommended to hold their shape better)</li>
            <li>Celery, chopped</li>
            <li>Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Liquids</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Beef broth (or stock)</li>
            <li>Red wine (a dry red like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot works well; optional, can be substituted with more beef broth).</li>
            <li>Water (may be used in combination with broth or as part of the liquid base). </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Aromatics and seasonings</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Olive oil (or other neutral cooking oil)</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour (for thickening)</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Bay leaf</li>
            <li>Dried thyme</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce (adds depth of flavor)</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Garnish(Optional)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1: Prepare the beef</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim any excess, easily removable fat from the beef chuck roast. Cut it into 1-1.5 inch cubes.</li>
            <li>Pat the beef dry with paper towels to ensure good browning and minimize steaming.</li>
            <li>Season the beef generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>You can also toss the beef in a small amount of flour (optional, but it helps thicken the sauce later).</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Step 2: Sear the beef</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil (or other cooking oil) in the pot over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Brown the beef in batches to prevent overcrowding the pot, ensuring each piece gets a nice sear and crust. Overcrowding can lead to steaming instead of browning.</li>
            <li>Remove the browned beef to a plate and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Step 3: Saute the aromatics and vegetables</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium</li>
            <li>Add the chopped onion, garlic, and celery to the pot.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened and slightly golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and cook for an additional minute, stirring to combine.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Step 4: Deglaze and add the liquids</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Return the browned beef and its juices to the pot.</li>
            <li>If using, add balsamic or red wine vinegar to the pot and stir, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan to add flavor to the stew base.</li>
            <li>Stir in the flour (if not done in Step 1) until it dissolves completely.</li>
            <li>Add the beef broth, red wine (if using), water, dried thyme, bay leaf, and Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, ensuring a gentle simmer. </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Step 5: Braise the stew</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid.</li>
            <li>Braise in the oven at 325°F (160°C) for approximately 2 hours, or until the beef is starting to become tender.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, simmer on the stovetop over the lowest setting for the same duration, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Step 6: Add the root vegetables</li>
        <ol>
            <li>After the initial braising time, add the carrots and potatoes to the pot.</li>
            <li>If cooking in the oven, return the covered pot to the oven and cook for another hour, or until the vegetables are tender and the beef is fork-tender</li>
            <li>If cooking on the stovetop, continue simmering for another 20-30 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the bay leaf.</li>
            <li>If the sauce is not thick enough, you can simmer uncovered for 30 minutes to allow it to reduce or create a cornstarch slurry and stir it in.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Final adjustments and serving</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Taste the stew and adjust seasoning (salt and pepper) if necessary.</li>
            <li>Serve warm, optionally garnished with fresh parsley.</li>
            <li>Consider serving with crusty bread, mashed potatoes, or rice to soak up the flavorful broth. </li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to use a slow cooker, sear the meat and saute the vegetables as instructed, then transfer everything to the slow cooker and cook on low for 7-8 hours or high for 4-5 hours. If needed, you can use a cornstarch slurry to thicken the stew at the end. Beef stew also improves in flavor when made ahead and refrigerated overnight.</p>
