    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the following ingredients to a large mixing bowl</li>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoon besan (gram flour) (¼ cup + 2 tbsps)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon rice flour or cornstarch</li>
            <li>⅓ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric (haldi)</li>
            <li>¾ to 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (reduce for kids)</li>
            <li>¾ to 1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>¾ tablespoon ginger garlic paste or crushed</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Next add the following</li>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ tablespoon ginger garlic paste or crushed ginger garlic</li>
            <li>1 to 2 green chilies chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>2 sprigs curry leaves or 2 tbsps mint leaves or coriander leaves chopped</li>
            <li>¼ cup onion (optional) fine chopped/sliced very thin</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Chop 250 grams boneless chicken to uniform bite sized pieces. Add it here.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 egg white.</li>
        <li>Begin to mix adding water only as needed. I add about 3 tbsps water. This may vary depending on the chicken
            and the size of the egg</li>
        <li>owards the end of this step, chicken should be well coated with the pakora mixture. The mixture has to be
            stiff – dough like and not like batter. Too mush moisture in the pakora mixture can make your chicken pakora
            soft and not crunchy.</li>
        <li><p>Heat oil in a deep pan/ kadai. Check if the temperature is right by sliding in little dough. It has to
            sizzle and rise to the surface without browning quickly. This is the right temperature.</p>

            <p>Slide the chicken bites gently to the hot oil one after the other. Regulate the flame to medium to medium
            high.</p>

            <p>It is very normal for the chicken pieces to stick up to each other in the mixing bowl. Just remove each
            piece of chicken and coat it well with the pakora mixture and slide them to the oil.</p></li>
        <li>After a minute or 2, stir and fry them until golden and crisp</li>
        <li><p>Once done remove the chicken pakora to a steel colander or cooling rack. Fry the entire chicken in batches
            following the same method. Ensure the oil is hot enough before frying a new batch of chicken.</p>

            <p>Each piece of chicken takes a different time to fry. So it is best to monitor each one of them and remove
            when they are done.</p></li>
