    <p>A Garlic Mushroom dish in a fancy restuarant that will blow you tastebuds.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Button Mushroom</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cumin</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>Chilies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add red chilies, garlic, salt, sugar, vinegar or lemon juice to a blender jar. You may deseed the red chilies, but we love the half crushed seeds in this, so I did not deseed them. For a cut short method, you can also skip blending and make a paste using chili powder, garlic mince and the rest of the ingredients with water as needed.</li>
        <li>Blend them together with just 1 to 2 tbsps water. You must get a slightly coarse thick paste. You can also add little chilli powder for color, i used about Â¼ tsp.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan with oil. Add a single strand of mace or half tsp cumin. Saute for 30 seconds. Add finely chopped onions. Saute until they turn lightly golden. While the onions fry, you can wash and chop or slice the mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Then add the garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Saute very well on a low to medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes. Make sure the raw smell of garlic has gone completely.</li>
        <li>Add chopped mushrooms.</li>
        <li>Mix well to coat the mushrooms with garlic sauce. Fry for about 3 mins, till you begin to smell the mushrooms good.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook until the mushrooms are done to your liking. Do not over cook as the texture of mushrooms change & will turn soggy.</li>
        <li>You can add few coriander leaves. You can also add in some cooked noodles or al dente cooked rice and saute for few minutes.</li>
